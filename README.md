# T-Display-Example

A minimal example of using the Lilygo T-Display S3 AMOLED with TFT_eSPI and Platformio.

This was made by lifting the necessary files from the Lilygo repository to create a single smaller
project.

There is no need to change the TFT_eSPI configuration -- that is taken care of automatically
by the Lilygo header files.

None of the code is mine. I have resisted the temptation to tidy some rather messy code. UPDATE: I
failed to resist. More tidying to be done.
